* How do we know whether the last character was accessed? Simply change the last character to all of the other possible characters one at a time and observe if a change in error occurs. If a change in error is observed, then it is indication that the last character value was compared.
* How do we manage the problem with closing deep prefixes? The idea is to simply limit execution to a fixed time out and if it does not complete, then step back a few characters (or drop the prefix completely) and go for a new exploration. Because the worst case is a dyck language, there is always the possibility that a fixed % of explorations will get us to a balanced (valid) string.
* How to deal with long processing times? The idea is that we only want to get past the parser. So have a time out, that is short enough to only account for parsing, and anything that exeeds it is flagged for later exploration. This way we collect seeds for other kinds of fuzzers.
